# Reaper Project Status

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Version**: v0.1.0-blocked
**Status**: 🛑 **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed with implementation

## 🛑 Project Blocked

**Reason**: Ruchy language lacks essential features for real projects

**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/paiml/ruchy/issues/106

**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks entire project

## Missing Language Features

| Feature | Status | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Multi-file modules (`mod scanner;`) | ❌ Not supported | All code in ONE file |
| Custom structs (`pub struct Process`) | ❌ Not supported | Cannot model domain |
| Enums (`pub enum Priority`) | ❌ Not supported | No type safety |

**Conclusion**: Current Ruchy (v3.154.0) cannot build the Reaper specification.

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### REAPER-001: Initialize Ruchy Project ✅
- Created via `ruchy new reaper`
- Cargo integration working
- Build system validated

### REAPER-002: Configure Quality Gates ✅
- pmat.toml with extreme quality standards
- .pmat-gates.toml for TDG enforcement
- CONTRIBUTING.md with extreme TDD workflow

### REAPER-003: Module Structure (BLOCKED) ⚠️
- Reference modules created (scanner, detector, terminator, config, logger, cli)
- Moved to `reference/` directory (documentation only)
- Minimal `src/main.ruchy` that compiles and runs

### STOP THE LINE Process ✅
- Ruchy limitations discovered during validation
- GitHub Issue #106 filed with clear reproduction
- BLOCKED.md created with complete analysis
- Workaround attempted (not viable)
- Project properly paused

### Complete Debugging & Quality Integration ✅
**While waiting for Issue #106 resolution:**

#### ruchydbg Integration
- ✅ Timeout detection (catches infinite loops)
- ✅ Type-aware tracing (shows argument/return types)
- ✅ Performance benchmarking
- ✅ DEBUGGING.md complete guide

#### PMAT Full Integration
- ✅ Complexity analysis (max 10, currently 2)
- ✅ SATD detection (zero tolerance enforced)
- ✅ Quality gates configured and enforced
- ✅ TDG baseline created and tracked
- ✅ Git hooks installed (pre-commit + post-commit)
- ✅ QUALITY.md complete guide (all 15 Ruchy tools)

#### Build System Integration
- ✅ Comprehensive Makefile (40+ targets)
- ✅ Quick checks: `make quality-quick`
- ✅ Full validation: `make quality-full`
- ✅ Complete workflow: `make validate`
- ✅ CI/CD targets: `make ci-checks`, `make ci-full`

**Tools Status**: All installed and validated
- ruchy v3.154.0
- ruchydbg v1.9.1
- pmat v2.183.0
- cargo (Rust 2021 edition)

## 💡 Recommendations

### Option 1: PAUSE (Recommended)
**Wait for Ruchy language features**
- Monitor paiml/ruchy#106 for updates
- Revisit when multi-file + structs + enums added
- Keep reference modules as future roadmap

### Option 2: SIMPLIFY
**Build within current capabilities**
- Simple calculator or string utility
- Single-file project
- No custom types needed
- Showcase what Ruchy CAN do today

### Option 3: CONTRIBUTE
**Help build Ruchy language**
- Implement multi-file module support
- Add struct/enum support
- Contribute to compiler development

## 🎯 What Ruchy CAN Do (v3.154.0)

**Working Features**:
- ✅ Basic functions
- ✅ Inline modules (all in one file)
- ✅ Primitive types (i32, f64, String, bool)
- ✅ Arrays and vectors
- ✅ Loops and conditionals
- ✅ println! output
- ✅ Cargo integration

**Example**:
```ruchy
fun calculate_sum(numbers: [i32]) -> i32 {
    let mut total = 0;
    let mut i = 0;
    while i < numbers.len() {
        total = total + numbers[i];
        i = i + 1;
    }
    total
}

fun main() {
    let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let result = calculate_sum(nums);
    println("Sum: {}", result);
}
```

## 🚫 What Ruchy CANNOT Do (Yet)

**Missing Features**:
- ❌ Separate module files
- ❌ Custom structs
- ❌ Enums
- ❌ Traits/interfaces
- ❌ Pattern matching (match)
- ❌ Error types (Result, Option)
- ❌ Closures
- ❌ Generics

**Impact**: Cannot build real-world applications that need:
- Domain modeling
- Type safety
- Multi-file organization
- Error handling
- State machines

## 🏆 Positive Outcomes

Despite blockers, this effort was **SUCCESSFUL**:

1. ✅ **Early Discovery**: Found limitations before weeks of wasted effort
2. ✅ **Proper Process**: Executed STOP THE LINE correctly
3. ✅ **Clear Documentation**: GitHub issue + BLOCKED.md
4. ✅ **Complete Tooling Integration**:
   - ruchydbg (debugging with type-aware tracing)
   - PMAT (TDG, complexity, SATD, quality gates)
   - Git hooks (pre-commit quality enforcement)
   - Comprehensive Makefile (40+ targets)
5. ✅ **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Ready to implement when unblocked
6. ✅ **Reference Value**: Shows what Ruchy needs for real projects
7. ✅ **Complete Documentation**: DEBUGGING.md + QUALITY.md guides

**Key Learnings**:
- Better to discover language limitations early!
- Use blocked time productively (integrated all tooling)
- Infrastructure first = smooth implementation later

## Next Session

**Current Status**: Complete tooling infrastructure in place

**Ready to Resume When**:
- Ruchy Issue #106 resolved (multi-file, struct, enum support)
- All infrastructure ready: debugging, quality, CI/CD
- Reference modules ready to move to `src/`
- Can immediately start implementing with full TDD

**Alternative Paths**:
1. **PAUSE** (Recommended): Monitor paiml/ruchy#106
2. **SIMPLIFY**: Design simpler project within current capabilities
3. **CONTRIBUTE**: Help implement missing Ruchy features

**Quick Start When Unblocked**:
```bash
# Move reference modules to src/
mv reference/*.ruchy src/

# Start TDD implementation
make quality-quick    # Pre-commit checks
make debug-trace      # Debug with type-aware tracing
make validate         # Full validation

# Ready to implement!
```
