# PROJECT OVERVIEW
overview:
  problem: |
    Development systems accumulate rogue background processes that consume excessive
    CPU/memory. Real incident (2025-10-31): 17 processes killed manually, system load 9-10.

  solution: |
    Pure Ruchy daemon that automatically detects and terminates rogue processes.
    Single binary deployment with <10MB memory, <100ms cold start.

  why_ruchy:
    - "Single binary deployment"
    - "Native system process interaction"
    - "Type-safe configuration"
    - "Showcase for Ruchy language"
    - "Publishes to crates.io as pure Rust"
